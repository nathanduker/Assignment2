# Notes & Process

<!-- How you built this project - Include images, gifs, and notes here -->

Simply built off of very basic boilerplate code, a bit of chatG and my own twist to break up areas into a cohesive grid that I then customised and styled
## Process & Documentation

<!-- Any specific challenges or struggles documented -->
I realise that an issue that I tend to struggle with is figuring out how positioning with CSS works and how to properly structure an HTML file for the sake of styling it.
